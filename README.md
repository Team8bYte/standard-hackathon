## Facial Verification System

This application uses face-api.js, a JavaScript API for face detection and recognition in the browser. The system:

1. **Captures** the user's face via webcam
2. **Extracts** facial features to create a unique descriptor
3. **Stores** the descriptor for new applicants (in localStorage)
4. **Verifies** returning applicants against their stored descriptor

### User Flow

1. User enables their camera
2. For new applications:
   - User clicks "New Application"
   - System captures and analyzes their face
   - A unique face ID is generated and associated with the loan application
   - User data is stored in localStorage for persistence
3. For returning applicants:
   - User clicks "Continue Application"
   - System matches their face against stored descriptors
   - If verified, they can continue their loan application
   - A match confidence score is displayed to the user

## Video Guidance System

This system provides an interactive video-based learning experience with voice-recorded responses and AI feedback.

### Features

- Sequential video playback with questions
- Voice recording for answers
- Automatic speech-to-text conversion
- AI-powered feedback on responses
- Progress tracking across segments
- Manual text editing capability

### Usage

1. Navigate to the manager dashboard
2. Watch each video segment
3. Record your answers using the microphone button
4. Edit transcribed text if needed
5. Get AI feedback on your responses
6. Progress through all segments and questions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure you're using HTTPS for reliable camera access
- Check browser permissions for camera access
- Position your face properly in good lighting
- Try using Chrome or Firefox if you experience issues
- Check the browser console for any specific error messages
